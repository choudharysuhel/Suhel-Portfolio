                <p>For my latest project, I started working on a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to create a fun and interactive game that users can play on their browser.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3 col-1>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>So far, I have designed the user interface for the game, created the game board using HTML, and
                    implemented the logic to track player moves using JavaScript. I have also started styling the game
                    board with CSS, giving it a clean and modern look.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3 col-1>Remaining Tasks</h3>
                <p>There are still several tasks that need to be completed in order to finish the project. These include
                    adding the logic to check for a winning move, implementing the computer player, and adding the
                    ability to reset the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3 col-1>Challenges</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out how to keep track of player moves and detect a
                    winning move. Through research and trial-and-error, I was able to implement the logic to track moves
                    and am currently working on the winning move logic.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Learning</h3>
                <p>Working on this project has allowed me to develop my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I have also
                    learned about the importance of project planning and organization in order to stay on track and meet
                    deadlines.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>While the project is currently unfinished, I plan to continue working on it and complete the
                    remaining tasks. I am excited to see the final result and to share it with others.</p>
