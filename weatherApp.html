                <p>For my latest project, I started working on a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is designed to display real-time weather information for a user's current location, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3 col-1>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>So far, I have built the user interface for the app, including a clean and modern design that is easy to use. I have also integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data and displayed it on the app.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Remaining Tasks</h3>
                <p>There are still several tasks that need to be completed in order to finish the project. These include adding the ability to search for weather information by city, displaying a 5-day forecast, and implementing additional weather icons.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Challenges</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to integrate an API into my project. However, with research and trial-and-error, I was able to successfully integrate the OpenWeatherMap API and display real-time weather data.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Learning</h3>
                <p>Working on this project has allowed me to develop my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I have also learned about the importance of API integration and how it can be used to add dynamic and real-time data to a web application.</p>

                <h3 col-1>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>While the project is currently unfinished, I plan to continue working on it and complete the remaining tasks. I am excited to see the final result and to potentially add additional features to make the app even more useful for users.</p>
